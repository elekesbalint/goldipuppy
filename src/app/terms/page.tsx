The Buyer consents at the same time as payment that the Service Provider sends the receipt to them electronically.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">V. PAYMENT METHODS AND CONDITIONS</h2>
            <p>The Service Provider indicates the full purchase price of the dog or the exact amount of the dog's deposit in the confirmation of the purchase placed by the Buyer (in case of reservation), i.e., the total amount to be paid. Furthermore, it indicates all necessary data and information in the confirmation that is essential for the successful execution of the payment transaction (exact total amount, information about payment methods, order identification number, etc.).</p>
            <p>The Buyer can pay the deposit or the full purchase price to the Service Provider in the following ways:</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">V.1. Payment by bank transfer:</h3>
            <p>In this case, the Buyer pays the full purchase price of the dog or the deposit (according to the Buyer's prior choice) before receiving the dog by bank transfer to the Service Provider's (Aranyi Attila sole proprietorship) IBAN HU55 104046015052658665521035 account number at K&H Bank. In case of advance transfer, the Buyer is only entitled to receive the dog after the transfer is credited, which the Service Provider will notify the Buyer immediately.</p>
            <p>The payment date is considered the day when the deposit or the full purchase price is credited to the Service Provider's bank account.</p>
            <p>If the deposit or the full purchase price is not credited to the Service Provider's bank account by the deadline set by the Service Provider due to the Buyer's payment delay, the Service Provider is entitled to withdraw from the contract. The Service Provider is obliged to notify the Buyer immediately by email in case of withdrawal due to buyer delay.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">VI. RESERVATION, PURCHASE PROCESS</h2>
            <p>Payment of the dog's deposit or full purchase price is tied to registration through the interface.</p>
            <p>The User has the opportunity to pay the deposit or full purchase price of the dog they choose from the dogs listed on the website regarding the selected dog.</p>
            <p>The registered User selects the dog they choose from the list on the Website and clicks the "Payment" button. The User has the opportunity to pay the deposit or settle the dog's full purchase price through the interface.</p>
            <p>In case of deposit payment, the deposit amount is minimum 500 Euros. After successfully paying the deposit on the advertising page, Users can optionally settle the remaining purchase price of the dog by clicking on the "My Reserved Dogs" menu item.</p>
            <p>The system indicates the exact amount of the deposit and the full purchase price. The User selects their chosen transaction and continues the purchase. Before payment, the Buyer gets to know and accepts the present Terms as binding. The system automatically offers the necessary, interconnected technical steps for contract conclusion to the Buyer. The Buyer can interrupt the process at any time until sending the order.</p>
            <p>Before finalizing the purchase, the Buyer has the opportunity to check the data they entered and correct any data entry errors. The order sent by the Buyer qualifies as a legal declaration aimed at contract conclusion. The electronically concluded contract is created when the Service Provider's confirmation of the order reaches the Buyer. The contract created in this way between the Parties, in Hungarian/English language, qualifies as a written contract. The Service Provider files the contract and keeps it for two years after its creation.</p>
            <p>The total purchase price always represents the gross price. The price is displayed in the currency selected by the user.</p>
            <p>The Service Provider reserves the right to change the prices of dogs listed on the website. The modification takes effect simultaneously with its appearance on the Website and does not affect the purchase price of already reserved or purchased dogs. If the Service Provider, despite all care, displays an incorrect price, especially a price that significantly differs from the dog's well-known, generally accepted or estimated price, or a "0" Euro or "1" Euro price due to system error, the Service Provider is not obliged to sell the product at the incorrect price. In this case, the Service Provider may offer sale at the correct price, upon knowledge of which the Buyer may withdraw from their purchase intention.</p>
            <p>Payment transactions are processed during business hours, weekdays between 8 and 19. There is also an opportunity to pay the deposit or full purchase price outside the above-mentioned times, if it happens after the end of working hours, it will be processed the next day.</p>
            <p>After the payment transaction, the Buyer receives an automatic system message about the purchase, which contains all important information about the purchase and the unique identification number of the transaction.</p>
            <p>If the Buyer wants to choose another dog, the previously paid purchase price will be credited to the newly selected dog's purchase price.</p>
            <p>The Service Provider's responsibility extends to ensuring that the Buyer actually receives the dog (based on unique identification, e.g., chip number) that was listed in the advertisement and that the documents listed there are also handed over.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">VII. DELIVERY CONFIRMATION</h2>
            <p>Proof of successful delivery is always the Buyer's responsibility (receipt, photo/video, etc.).</p>
            <p>By sending the successful confirmation, the Buyer simultaneously acknowledges that the purchased dog is visibly healthy at the time of receipt and has all the documents that the Service Provider listed on the website and included in the dog's purchase price.</p>
            <p>The Buyer is obliged to confirm the successful receipt of the dog within 48 hours of the notification. If the given confirmation deadline is missed, the Service Provider assumes that the delivery was successful.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">VIII. SERVICE PROVIDER EVALUATION</h2>
            <p>We provide registered Users with the opportunity to evaluate the Service Provider on the website after the confirmation of the successful delivery of the given dog reaches the Service Provider.</p>
